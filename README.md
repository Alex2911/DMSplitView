## Introduction

DMSplitView is a revisited version of the standard OSX's NSSplitView control.
 The e problem with NSSplitView is that some things which should be simple require implementing unintuitive delegate methods, which gets to be pretty annoying.
 DMSplitView offer a powerful control over some important settings of NSSplitView such like:
 
* subview's size and constraint (Specificy uniform, proportional, or priority-based resizing, min/max sizes for subviews)
* dividers positions
* collapsible subviews (specify whether a subview can collapse)
* animatable transitions (both on dividers and subview's sizes)
* control over divider thickness and style
* save/restore state of dividers (using standard's OS X autosave feature)
